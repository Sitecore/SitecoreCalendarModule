&lt;p class="Default" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;Sitecore License Agreement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;LICENSEE’S USE OF THE SITECORE SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO
LICENSEE’S FULL ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS, CONDITIONS, DISCLAIMERS AND LICENSE
RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
" arial","sans-serif""=""&gt;1. &lt;u&gt;License Grant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""=""&gt;: Upon payment in
full of the license fee, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, perpetual,
non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable license, without time
limitations, to use the Sitecore Software, in object code form only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""=""&gt;
exclusively for management of Licensee’s own current and future web
infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""=""&gt;,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this License Agreement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""=""&gt; Except as
expressly authorized by this Agreement, “Licensee” as used herein does not
include any other entity or person, including any present or future subsidiary
or affiliate of Licensee, or any entity or person owning any interest in
Licensee at present or in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""=""&gt; “Sitecore Software” means the
software that is licensed by Licensor in this Agreement, and any future
Upgrades and Patches, as those terms are defined in Section 6 of this
Agreement, that the Licensee may receive in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:" arial","sans-serif""=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

margin-left:.3in;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;1.1
License Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;: Licensee will be
provided a License Key that gives Licensee access to the Sitecore Software. The
Sitecore Software may be used only on the equipment with the features and
limitations specified in the License Key. The License Key shall be time-limited
until full payment of the license fee has been received by Licensor. The
License Key may limit the number of Servers on which the Sitecore Software may
be installed. For purposes of this Agreement, one Server is defined as one
installation and / or application instance on a physical or virtual Server with
a processing power for the web process equivalent to at most eight CPU cores.
For example, one physical Server may contain eight single core CPUs, four dual
core CPUs, two quad core CPUs or one eight core CPU. A Server with three or
four quad core CPUs would therefore count as two Servers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;A virtual server will be counted as the number of
physical cores allocated or processor core equivalents allocated to the virtual
server.&amp;nbsp; For example, one virtual server with two physical processor cores
allocated, or with the equivalent of two simulated processor cores allocated,
would be counted as the equivalent of one physical dual-core processor server.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:.3in;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;1.2
Intellectual Property Rights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;:
Ownership of the Sitecore Software, and all worldwide rights, title and
interest in and to the Intellectual Property associated with the Sitecore Software
shall remain solely and exclusively with Licensor or with third parties that license
modules included with the Sitecore Software. Licensee shall retain intact all
applicable Licensor copyright, patent and/or trademark notices on and in all
copies of the Sitecore Software. All rights, title, and interest in Sitecore
Software not expressly granted to Licensee in this Agreement are reserved by
Licensor. “Intellectual Property” as used in this Agreement means any and all
patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and trade names (registered and
unregistered), trade secrets, know-how, inventions, licenses and all other
proprietary rights throughout the world related to the authorship, origin,
design, utility, process, manufacture, programming, functionality and operation
of Sitecore Software and its Derivative Works, any product containing any
components of the Sitecore Software, all documentation (electronically stored
or otherwise), including manuals and marketing materials, regarding the
Sitecore Software, and any Confidential Information associated with the
Sitecore Software. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:.3in;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;1.3
Confidential Information: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;“Confidential
Information” as used in this Agreement means any information, whether tangible
or intangible, including, but not limited to, techniques, discoveries,
inventions, ideas, processes, software (in source or object code form),
designs, technology, technical specifications, flow charts, procedures,
formulas, concepts, financial data and business and marketing plans maintained
in confidence by Licensor, including confidential or proprietary information of
third parties that Licensor has been authorized to receive. Confidential
Information does not include information that (a) is now, or hereafter becomes,
through no act or failure to act on the part of Licensee, generally known or
available to the public; (b) was rightfully in Licensee’s possession prior to
disclosure by Licensor; (c) is developed independently by Licensee without
unauthorized use of or reference to any of Licensor’s Confidential Information;
or (d) is approved by Licensor for disclosure without restriction, in a written
document executed by a duly authorized officer of Licensor. Licensee shall not
disclose any Confidential Information associated with the Sitecore Software. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:.3in;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;1.4
Restrictions on Use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;: Except as
expressly authorized by Licensor in writing, Licensee shall not (a) copy, in
whole or in part, the Sitecore Software or documentation; (b) modify,
disassemble, decompress, reverse compile, reverse assemble, reverse engineer,
or translate any portion of the Sitecore Software; (c) rent, lease, lend,
distribute, sell, assign, license, or otherwise transfer the Sitecore Software;
or (d) create Derivative Works of the Sitecore Software.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:.3in;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;1.5  Derivative
Works: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;“Derivative Works” as used
herein means any software program (whether in source code or object code), and
all copies thereof, developed by or on behalf of Licensee based on or derived
from any part of the Sitecore Software, including without limitation any
revision, modification, enhancement, translation (including compilation or
recapitulation by computer), abridgment, condensation, expansion, or any other
form in which the Sitecore Software may be recast, transformed or adapted, and
that, if prepared without Licensor's authorization, would constitute a patent,
copyright or trade secret infringement of the Sitecore Software, or would
otherwise constitute an unauthorized use of Licensor’s Confidential
information. In the event any such Derivative Works are created, Licensor shall
own all right, title, and interest in and to such Derivative Works. If, under
the operation of local law or otherwise, Licensee or such third party comes to
have any rights associated with such Derivative Works, Licensee hereby and
shall automatically assign all such rights to Licensor for no additional
consideration. For avoidance of doubt, Licensor shall claim no intellectual
property interest or legal interest of any kind in any code created by Licensee
to facilitate its authorized use of the Sitecore Software so long as the
creation of such code does not constitute a Derivative Work or violate any other
provision of this Agreement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:.3in;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;1.6
Third Party Use and Rights: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;Licensee
may authorize third parties to assist Licensee in the management, editing, and
hosting of web based content created by use of the Sitecore Software, provided
that: (1) such activities are within the scope of the activities Licensee is
itself authorized to perform under this Agreement; (2) such third party’s acts
are primarily for the direct or indirect benefit of Licensee; and (3) such
third parties are not charged a fee by Licensee for such activities. Licensee
is prohibited from using the Sitecore Software as an Application Software
Provider, or in any time-sharing or other commercial arrangement of any kind
that makes the Sitecore Software available to third parties primarily for the
third party’s own uses. Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, no third
party has any rights under this Agreement. Licensee is fully liable to the
extent allowed by law for any unauthorized use of the Sitecore Software by
third parties caused by any acts or omissions of Licensee. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:.3in;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;1.7
Transmission of Limited Licensee Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;:
The Sitecore Software periodically transmits the following information to a
server maintained by Licensor: License Key ID, licensee name, hostname
(Licensee’s website URL), host IP, and directory installation path. This
information is used by Licensor to send periodic communications to Licensee
relevant to use of the Sitecore Software, and to verify that the Sitecore
Software is being used in authorized locations only. Licensee expressly
consents to the transmission of such information. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;2. &lt;u&gt;Limited Warranties&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;2.1
Licensor’s Limited Warranty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;: Licensor
expressly warrants that the Sitecore Software provided to Licensee will work
for a period of ninety (90) days following the effective date of this Agreement
according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;the then current functional,
operational, and/or performance capabilities of the Sitecore Software&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;as
set forth in the Sitecore Developer Network. In the event any such Sitecore
Software does not operate according to these capabilities during this Limited
Warranty Period, Licensor shall repair or replace the Sitecore Software and
such repair or replacement shall be Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;2.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Virus/Malicious Code Warranty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;: Licensor and Licensee warrant that they will use commercially
reasonable virus and malicious code detection software programs to test the Sitecore
Software licensed hereunder for viruses and malicious code prior to any delivery
or installation and that the parties will continue to take such steps with
respect to any software delivered pursuant to this Agreement. In the event either
party detects any computer virus or malicious code it shall immediately notify the
other party and Licensor shall promptly provide revised replacement software in
the event any such computer virus or malicious code is detected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;3. &lt;u&gt;DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES&lt;/u&gt;: EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 2 ABOVE, THE SITECORE SOFTWARE AND THE
ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION ARE SUPPLIED TO LICENSEE &amp;quot;AS IS.” LICENSOR
(DEFINED IN THIS SECTION AS LICENSOR’S PARENT, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES,
DISTRIBUTORS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES) MAKES NO WARRANTY,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE SITECORE SOFTWARE, SITECORE APPS, THE ASSOCIATED
DOCUMENTATION, THE OPERATION OF THE SITECORE SOFTWARE, THE SITECORE MAINTENANCE
PROGRAM, OR ANY OTHER GOODS OR SERVICES RENDERED BY LICENSOR TO LICENSEE,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. LICENSOR
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES THAT
THE SITECORE SOFTWARE WILL RUN PROPERLY ON ANY HARDWARE, THAT THE SITECORE
SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE’S REQUIREMENTS OR OPERATE IN THE COMBINATIONS WHICH
MAY BE SELECTED FOR USE BY LICENSEE, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SITECORE SOFTWARE
WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.
LICENSOR MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND REGARDING ANY
SEPARATELY LICENSED SOFTWARE OR SITECORE APPS THAT MAY BE USED WITH THE
SITECORE SOFTWARE.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;4. &lt;u&gt;LIMITATION OF LIABILITY&lt;/u&gt;: LICENSOR (DEFINED
IN THIS SECTION AS LICENSOR’S PARENT, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTORS
AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO
LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR ANY AGREEMENT RELATED TO ANY SITECORE APPS, UNDER ANY LEGAL
THEORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, THE COST OF RECOVERING ANY DATA, INFRINGEMENT, OR THE COST OF
SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, KNOWS OF, OR SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ALL AGREEMENTS RELATED TO ANY SITECORE APPS), SHALL
NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES (NOT INCLUDING MAINTENANCE PROGRAM CHARGES) PAID
BY LICENSEE FOR USE OF THE SITECORE SOFTWARE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. LICENSOR
WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS OR FAILURES IN PERFORMANCE OF THE SUPPORT OR ANY
OTHER SERVICES CAUSED BY FORCES BEYOND ITS CONTROL OR ANY FORCE MAJEURE EVENT
SUCH AS ACT OF TERRORISM, LOSS OF POWER, ACT OF GOD, OR SIMILAR OCCURRENCE OR
FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY LICENSEE’S FAILURE TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT. THE LIMITATION PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO ANY
CLAIM FILED BY LICENSEE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY SEPARATELY LICENSED
SOFTWARE THAT MAY BE USED WITH THE SITECORE SOFTWARE. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;5. &lt;u&gt;Sitecore Maintenance Program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt; The
Sitecore Maintenance Program includes Upgrades and support. Upgrades are free
of charge for as long as Licensee is enrolled in the Maintenance Program.
Licensee will automatically be included in the Maintenance Program and will be
charged an annual fee of 20% of the listed retail cost of all software
purchased. The Maintenance Program is free of charge for the first year after
the initial purchase of Sitecore Software. Three years after the date of the
initial purchase and each three-year anniversary thereafter, Licensor may
adjust the Maintenance Program charge then in effect for all software purchased
under this Agreement to 20% of the Licensor’s then-current retail prices.
Licensee may cancel the Maintenance Program by providing Licensor with 60 days
notice prior to the end of any 12-month Maintenance Program period.    Licensor
may cancel the Maintenance Program upon Licensee’s failure to pay timely any
applicable Maintenance Program charge. A cancelled Maintenance Program may not
be renewed except upon payment of double the amount of fees that would have
been paid during the lapsed period. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;6. &lt;u&gt;Upgrades and Patches of Sitecore Software&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;: “Patch” as used in this Agreement means a specific,
targeted fix to a discrete problem in the use or functionality of the Sitecore
Software that Licensor in its sole discretion defines to constitute a “Patch”
and may from time to time provide to Licensee. “Upgrade” as used in this
Agreement means a new version of some or all of the Sitecore Software, or an
improvement in the use or functionality of the Software more substantial than a
Patch, that Licensor in its sole discretion defines to constitute an “Upgrade”
and may from time to time provide to Licensees enrolled in the Sitecore
Maintenance program. Licensee expressly acknowledges that Upgrades and Patches
may change functionality of the Software and integration with other systems,
and may not work with some or all of the Sitecore Software modules, or be
backward compatible with earlier versions of Sitecore Software. Installation of
Patches and Upgrades is the choice and responsibility of Licensee. To the
extent that operation of the Sitecore Software is affected by problems in
standard software, including, but not limited to, Microsoft Internet Explorer,
Windows and the Microsoft.Net, then Licensee shall install updates to such
standard software per Licensor’s specifications in order to resolve these
issues. Licensor has no control over such standard software, and cannot assure
that problems with such standard software will be corrected, or that such
corrections will be made in a timely manner. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;7. &lt;u&gt;Injunctive Relief Authorized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;: Licensor and Licensee agree that the remedy at law
for any breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions in Section 1
(including all subsections in Section 1) are inadequate, and in addition to any
other remedy available at law or equity under this Agreement, a party shall be
entitled to seek injunctive relief for violations of Section 1 and its
subsections, as well as for violations of any other Section as may be
authorized by law or equity. The prevailing party in any such action for
injunctive relief shall be entitled to recover all of its attorney fees and
costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:" calibri","sans-serif""=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;8.  &lt;u&gt;Waivers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:
10.0pt"&gt;: All waivers must be in writing and signed by authorized
representatives of the parties. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision
of this Agreement on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of any other
provision or of such provision on any other occasion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;9.  &lt;u&gt;Severability&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;: If any provision of this Agreement is adjudicated to
be unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed changed and interpreted to
accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible
under applicable law and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force
and effect. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;10.  &lt;u&gt;Assignment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10.0pt"&gt;: Licensee may not assign or transfer its interests,
rights, or obligations under this Agreement by written agreement, merger,
consolidation, operation of law, or otherwise, without the prior written
consent of an authorized executive officer of Licensor. Licensor may assign
this Agreement to a successor (whether by merger, a sale of all or a
significant portion of its assets, a sale of a controlling interest of its
capital stock, or otherwise) that agrees to assume Licensor’s obligations under
this Agreement. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this
Section shall be void and of no force or effect.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Subject to the
provisions of this Section, this Agreement shall be binding upon successors and
assigns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

protecting copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, when such
intellectual property violations are caused by use of the Software or creation
of content not authorized by Sitecore; (3) Violates any agreement from a third
party vendor engaged by Licensor to provide services to Licensee; (4) Promotes
the creation or transmission of spam, hacking, phishing, phreaking, computer
viruses or malicious code; (5) Seeks, without authorization,  to monitor,
interfere with,  or gain access to the data, systems or networks of Licensor or
any third party;( (6) Uses any false, misleading, or deceptive network packet
header information; (7) Distributes software that covertly gathers information
about a user or covertly transmits information about a user; (8) Distributes
advertisement delivery software unless: (i) the user affirmatively consents to
the download and installation of such software based on a clear and conspicuous
notice of the nature of the software, and (ii) the software is easily removable
by use of standard tools for such purpose included on major operating systems;
(such as Microsoft's &amp;quot;ad/remove&amp;quot; tool); and (9) Is likely to result
in retaliation against the Licensor or a third party vendor’s  network or
website, including engaging in conduct that results in any server being the
target of a denial of service attack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
